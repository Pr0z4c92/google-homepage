my first major website design. 
going to be using some dev tools to develop my skills and learn how to identify colors and locations so that i can do a close cope of google.
i will also be adding my knowledge to HTML editing and css coding.

learning alot. mainly about section. i have been working on this site for roughly 3 hrs all up i would say so far. is taking longer then i thought it would but then again i also still have little idea on what everything does. thankfully some guy on discord is givving me a hand so there is that.

i have practically started using this as a journal to log everything. serious though,
